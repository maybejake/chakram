### Chakram adds a new mid-range throwing weapon made from echo shards and breeze rods, the chakram! When thrown, chakrams will ricochet off of any blocks they hit. For each ricochet, the damage done by the chakram will increase! The chakram will fly right back into your hand if you hit an entity or throw it the maximum distance!
